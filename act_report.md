## Multiple Dog_stages:
   Even after extracting the dog_stage from the tweet, Some of the tweets mention multiple dog stages(there might me many reasons for this). Therefore I replaced the multiple dogstages with __"multiple"__ in the dog_stage column. and I found that there were 13 tweets which mention mutiple dogstages and There are more than 1750+ tweets which donot mention any dog stage at all. 

   One reason for multiple dog_stages could be rating of multiple dogs in the same tweet.
